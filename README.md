PHYS ### L01/02- (Winter 2018) - Computational Physics I

Course Outcomes
1. Analyse physical and astrophysical problems from the computational viewpoint. Construct mathematical and
numerical models of many common physical and astrophysical processes while constructing appropriate logical
approaches to physical and astrophysical solutions
2. Master basic programming (Python). Code and implement programmes.
3. Plot, visualize and analyse data using state-of-the-art graphic software (e.g. numpy, matplotlib, scipy)
4. Incorporate modern computation and visualization into the scientific problem-solving paradigm via a project
approach.
5. Convey technical information with precision and concision. Communicate effectively solution methods and results using
scientific reports
6. Assess impact of round-off and truncation errors on numerical solutions of physical processes. Grasp the
necessary numerical analysis and its associated approximation and round-off error
7. Understand Numbers, error propagation and loss of accuracy resulting from number and function representation
in computers
8. Understand the basic concepts of computing: algorithms, precision, efficiency, and verification
9. Master numerical methods for solution of systems of equations (matrix analysis, LU decomposition etc ...),
Scalars, vectors, and matrices (matrix operations)
